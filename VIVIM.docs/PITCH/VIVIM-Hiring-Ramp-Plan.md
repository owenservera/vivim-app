# TEAM SIZE CALCULATIONS

## Vibe Coding Adjusted Formula

**Traditional formula (no AI):**
```
Required Devs = (Total Dev Hours) / (Hours per Dev per Month)
```

**Vibe Coding formula:**
```
Required Devs = (Total Dev Hours × AI_Efficiency_Factor) / (Hours per Dev per Month)

Where:
- AI_Efficiency_Factor = 0.35–0.50 (depending on task type)
- Tasks with high AI applicability = 0.35
- Tasks with low AI applicability = 0.50
```

## Role Requirements by Milestone

### Key Principles:
1. **Smaller teams** with AI augmentation
2. **Poly技能** developers preferred (full-stack with AI)
3. **Architectural oversight** still requires senior human involvement
4. **Code review** is critical quality gate
5. **24/7 AI access** enables round-the-clock development

# KEY INSIGHTS

## Vibe Coding Impact on Hiring

1. **60% smaller teams** needed vs traditional development
2. **2–3x faster** time to market
3. **Focus shifts** from code generation to:
   - Architecture decisions (still human)
   - Code review (human critical)
   - System design (human critical)
   - Quality assurance (human critical)

4. **Ideal team profile**:
   - Senior engineers (better at prompting + code review)
   - Full-stack (more versatile with AI)
   - Lower headcount, higher expertise

5. **Risk mitigation**:
   - Always have human code review
   - Security audit at each milestone
   - Test coverage remains critical
   - Don't skip architectural planning

## Recommended Team Structure

| Configuration | Philosophy | Best For |
|--------------|------------|----------|
| **Low** | 1 founder + 1 senior + AI | MVP, proof of concept |
| **Medium** | 2 senior + 1 mid + AI | Full-featured product |
| **High** | 3 senior + 2 mid + AI | Enterprise-grade |
